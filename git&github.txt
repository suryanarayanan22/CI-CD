Git is the local repository
Github is the remote repository
combaining all task is called continus integration
Eg: working copy/Pc1==commit==local repostory == push ==Remote repostry ==pull == local repostory == update == working copy/Pc 2

Create local folder and make this as git local repostry. how to make it as git local repository
we need to navigate to tha folder using git and initialize the local repostory into git
$git init
To establish the connection with git and github
$git remote add orgin "https://orginurl"
only after commit the files will be available from local to git

branch is folder(in github)
we can pull the files from gitub to git
$git pull orgin master (will pull all the files)

git status will give what all the files are there in git
$git status
To push from local sys to github, first you need to add to index from index you can commit. add all the files from local to index
$git add test.txt (this will add in index)
$git add -A (will add all the files from local)
now to add to github, first time it will ask username and email
git config --global user.name "surya"
git config --global user.email "sury@gmail.com"
$git commit -m "first test"
$git commit -a (all the files)
to push all the folder evey time, you have to pull than only you have to push
$git pull orgin master 
$git push orgin master

install the git plugin in eclipse market place as Egit-git integration for eclipse
Step 1:) create/clone the git repostory in eclipse
  click on open perspective/search for git
  if there is no repositry available than you have click on clone git repository and clone into view
  than provide the url from github eg: https://github.com/suryanarayanan22/CI-CD.git
  click next and than click next agin  and in directory field the location of git will be present(first git should be installed before this step)
  click finish now we have created local git repostory for the project
Step 2:) commit the code into git repository and push into github 
      right click on the project and click on team and click on share project
      select the repository name,browse the name from git repostory
      right clikc on the project and click on team and click on commit(which will be available only in local git
      Once the user click on commit than you see unstaged stages which means changes where not made in 
      drag and drop from unstaged changes to staged changes 
      click on commit, commit is mandatory 
      than click on commit or commit and push (means code will be part of local directory and also in github repostory)
      we can commit single file by clicking on that file and click on team and share project it goes on like that above
      coz we have created the file and modified it will be defaulty it will show in staged changes we can directly commit instead of drag and drop

Step 3:) pull from github to local repository
     right click on the project and click on team and click on pull
