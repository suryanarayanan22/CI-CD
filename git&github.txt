Git is the local repository
Github is the remote repository
combaining all task is called continus integration
Eg: working copy/Pc1==commit==local repostory == push ==Remote repostry ==pull == local repostory == update == working copy/Pc 2

Create local folder and make this as git local repostry. how to make it as git local repository
we need to navigate to tha folder using git and initialize the local repostory into git
$git init
To establish the connection with git and github
$git remote add orgin "https://orginurl"
only after commit the files will be available from local to git

branch is folder(in github)
we can pull the files from gitub to git
$git pull orgin master (will pull all the files)

git status will give what all the files are there in git
$git status
To push from local sys to github, first you need to add to index from index you can commit. add all the files from local to index
$git add test.txt (this will add in index)
$git add -A (will add all the files from local)
now to add to github
$git commit -m "first test"
$git commit -a (all the files)
to push all the folder evey time, you have to pull than only you have to push
$git pull orgin master 
$git push orgin master
