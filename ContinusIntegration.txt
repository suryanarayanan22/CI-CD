install the git plugin in eclipse market place as Egit-git integration for eclipse
Step 1:) create/clone the git repostory in eclipse
  click on open perspective/search for git
  if there is no repositry available than you have click on clone git repository and clone into view
  than provide the url from github eg: https://github.com/suryanarayanan22/CI-CD.git
  click next and than click next agin  and in directory field the location of git will be present(first git should be installed before this step)
  click finish now we have created local git repostory for the project
Step 2:) commit the code into git repository and push into github 
      right click on the project and click on team and click on share project
      select the repository name,browse the name from git repostory
      right clikc on the project and click on team and click on commit(which will be available only in local git
      Once the user click on commit than you see unstaged stages which means changes where not made in 
      drag and drop from unstaged changes to staged changes 
      click on commit, commit is mandatory 
      than click on commit or commit and push (means code will be part of local directory and also in github repostory)
      we can commit single file by clicking on that file and click on team and share project it goes on like that above
      coz we have created the file and modified it will be defaulty it will show in staged changes we can directly commit instead of drag and drop

Step 3:) pull from github to local repository
     right click on the project and click on team and click on pull
